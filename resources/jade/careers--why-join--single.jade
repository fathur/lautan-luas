          h2 The Lautan Luas core values guide our daily work
          p We have 6 core values:
          ul
            li We comply with high ethical standards, 
            li We  commit to excellence, accountability and responsibility in all activities, 
            li We serve our customers to the best of our ability, 
            li We recognize and reward creativity,
            li We treat all people with respect, and 
            li We work as a team to achieve common goals.

          p These values define a standard of behavior for all employees and teach us how to relate with  our colleagues, customers and other third parties. They establish the basis for a working culture, the develpment of supporting company policies and code of conduct, and provide clarity for us as we strive to achieve the PT Lautan Luas Tbk vision and mission.

          p Implementing these values is not as difficult as it may seem, because we have learned them from childhood. As adults, we must simply shed the sometimes harsh compromises we have adopted as we came into the working environment and embrace them once more. We begin with ourselves, by adopting the values, and demonstrating respect for each other. By our commitment to good behavior, high morality and honesty, we can achieve - One Team, One Heart.
